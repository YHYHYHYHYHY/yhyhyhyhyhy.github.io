Hi, I am Hengyu Ye, currently a master student of computer science in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research interests include AI for Infrastructure, Time Series Analysis, Cloud Computing, Data Mining and Machine Learning. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the application of AI / DM techniques on performance optimization of cloud systems, with a special focus on proactive autoscaling and scheduling of VMs/containers in cloud environment based on forecasting techniques. If you are also interested with this topic, feel free to contact me for potential cooperation.

<!-- My current works focus on improving Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling) under proactive autoscaling manner. This include finding an effective, accurate and efficient workload / metric forecasting method, together with the recommandation of optimal number of pods given predicted workload / metric data. If you are also interested with this topic, feel free to contact me for potential cooperation. -->
