Hi, I am Hengyu Ye, currently a master student of computer science in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research interests center around the intersection of AI and systems, with a particular emphasis on cloud systems. Specifically, they encompass the following aspects:

1) AI - Aided Intelligent Cloud Infrastructure: I'm intrigued by leveraging AI techniques to enhance cloud infrastructure. This could involve using AI forecasting algorithms to optimize resource allocation, improve anomaly detection, and enhance the overall reliability and performance of cloud - based services.

2) Cloud Systems for AI. This area focuses on resource management and performance optimization in cloud systems for both AI training and inference processes. It includes developing strategies to allocate computing resources more efficiently, such as CPU, GPU, and memory, to ensure that AI models are trained and deployed in the most cost - effective and high - performance manner.
<!-- My research interests include AI for Infrastructure, Time Series Analysis, Cloud Computing, Data Mining and Machine Learning. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the application of AI / DM techniques on performance optimization of cloud systems, with a special focus on proactive autoscaling and scheduling of VMs/containers in cloud environment based on forecasting techniques. If you are also interested with this topic, feel free to contact me for potential cooperation. -->

My current work is concentrated on enhancing Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling) through a proactive autoscaling approach. This include building an effective, accurate and efficient AI model for workload forecasting, together with the recommandation of optimal number of pods given predicted workload data. 

If you're interested in these topics, feel free to reach out so we can explore potential collaboration opportunities.
