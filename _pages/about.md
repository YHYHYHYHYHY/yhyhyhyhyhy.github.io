Hi, I am Hengyu Ye, currently a master student of computer science in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research interests include AI for Infra, Time Series Analysis, Cloud Computing, Data Mining and Machine Learning. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the application of AI / DM techniques on performance optimization of cloud systems. 

My current works focus on improving Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling) under proactive autoscaling manner. This include finding an effective, accurate and efficient workload / metric forecasting method, together with the recommandation of optimal number of pods given predicted workload / metric data. If you are also interested with this topic, feel free to contact me for potential cooperation.
